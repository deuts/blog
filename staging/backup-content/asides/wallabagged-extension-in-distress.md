The Wallabag Chrome Extension feels about as useful as a bookmark on a broken page. Despite providing the correct client ID, client token, username, and password, it steadfastly refuses to work. It’s like yelling at a locked door with the key in hand.

Wallabag, if you’re listening, please fix this! Otherwise, I might just give Readeck a spin—and who knows, it might read me better than you do.
