  title="PortChecker - Check for Open Ports EASILY" 
  description="Learn how to self-host portchecker.io using a Docker container! This handy tool allows you to check the port status of any hostname or IP address, which is essential for managing port forwarding and network security.  In this video, we'll walk you through the entire process, from downloading the Docker image to accessing your own private instance of portchecker.io."

Honestly, I’m not sure why you'd bother self-hosting {{< applink "PortChecker" >}}—it's just a tool to check your server's port status. You can easily use the [website](https://portchecker.io/) for that. It’s not like it’s going to keep tabs on your ports 24/7, so unless you’re on a mission to host *everything* yourself, this might be a bit much!
