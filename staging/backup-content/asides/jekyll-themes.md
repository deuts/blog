Jekyll themes like [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) and [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) are some of the reasons why I would like to revisit my decision in the {{< applink "Hugo" >}} vs. {{< applink "Jekyll" >}} [debate]({{% ref "/posts/hugo-vs-jekyll/index.md" %}}).
