I don't think they are comparable. Notion is for note-taking app/service while Airtable is for databases and workflow. You may also build databases in Notion but it's quite limited in functionality. And Airtable has robust API that you can interact with using [Excel](https://deuts.net/2022/03/how-to-use-excel-power-query-to-retrieve-data-from-airtable/).
