[This article](https://www.theringer.com/tv/2022/11/3/23437524/andor-vs-house-of-the-dragon-rings-of-power-best-show) promises I would enjoy Andor. I should probably start watching these *Star Wars* TV shows.

How come every time I come here to just post a quick short post, I end up with a long one?

[Excel is dead?](https://every.to/p/the-end-of-excel) What a stupid question. This guy doesn't use Microsoft Excel as much as I do. Such a click-bait.

[Yugatech](https://www.yugatech.com/news/disney-plus-coming-to-the-philippines-on-november-17/): Disney+ coming to the Philippines on November 17. Price starts at P159 for mobile plan and P369 for premium. Take your pick: you split the subscription price, or just do everything, every streaming service, on Plex.

A [bridge collapsed](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/regions/848725/bridge-in-bayambang-pangasinan-collapses/story/) in Bayambang, Pangasinan. That's why it's so scary to be stuck in traffic while in the middle of a bridge.

### The Underrated TV Shows in 2022

I think these are the shows you shouldn't miss in 2022:
- WeCrashed
- Slow Horse
- The Dropout
- Severance
- Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty
- Blackbird

Of course, the **House of the Dragon** is not mentioned in this list, because it belongs to a totally different list.

### Legacy: The True Story of the LA Lakers
This TV series is so full of rich stories about the story behind the LA Lakers upon the ascension of Jerry Buss to the head of the organization. But it's also full of interviews, and less drama actually.
