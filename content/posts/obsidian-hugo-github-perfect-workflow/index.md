## My Notes
- I think I found the perfect combination/workflow for blogging with Hugo
- In the light of the recent drama surrounding Matt Mullenweg and WP Engine that affected the whole WordPress community, I'm leaning towards blogging with Hugo instead moving forward. This is especially true taking into account the advantages that Hugo offers:
  - Performance: Hugo serves static HTML, making it lightning-fast without backend processing.
  - Security: No database or PHP means far fewer vulnerabilities compared to WordPress.
  - Customization: Full control over templates and layouts without plugin bloat.
  - Version Control: Easy to track changes with Git, ideal for collaboration.
  - Low Maintenance: No updates or patches; Hugo sites are simpler to maintain.
- When I started blogging with Hugo some 2 years ago, I found that updating (with new posts) and maintaining (i.e. editing previous posts) can be a chore
- I'm not keen on using any Obsidian plugins for export to static site generator or to Hugo directly, as I have described in my [other post](/hugo-and-obsidian-workflow/)
  - I want this to be as standalone as possible. I don't want to be dependent on some plugins to be functioning for a long time in order to keep my workflow effective
  - Of course I have helper plugins like Templater (for creating new posts from templates and generating shortcodes like youtube) and Dataview plugin for taking a look at the summary of all posts, but they don't necessarily affect the publishing process/workflow
