## My Notes
- I think I found the perfect combination for blogging 
- I'm not keen on using any Obsidian plugins for export to static site generator or to Hugo directly, as I have described in my [other post](/hugo-and-obsidian-workflow/)
  - I want this to be as standalone as possible. I don't want to be dependent on some plugins to be functioning for a long time in order to keep my workflow effective
  - Of course I have helper plugins like Templater (for creating new posts from templates and generating shortcodes like youtube) and Dataview plugin for taking a look at the summary of all posts, but they don't necessarily affect the publishing process/workflow
