I've recently seen these Youtube shorts that promote The Smoothie Diet. I'm sure the Youtube channel that uploads these videos (@Animememes1) is simply grabbing some weight transformation videos from Tiktok, upload them as Shorts in their Youtube channel, and adding a link in the comments about the Smoothie Diet.

Please don't fall for this scam. These smoothies are so full of sugar, you don't want them on your bodies. The real weight-loss strategy is totally free &mdash; you don't have to pay a dime, you have nothing in advance to prepare: **Intermittent Fasting**. 

Look it up, especially about the power and benefits of the '*clean*' fast. And while you're at it, you would help yourself better if you try and read Gin Stephen's *Fast, Feast, Repeat* and *Delay, Don't Deny*.
