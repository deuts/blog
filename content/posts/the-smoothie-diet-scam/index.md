description: The author warns against falling for scams promoted by YouTube shorts, particularly those advertising The Smoothie Diet. They explain that these smoothies are often high in sugar and ineffective for weight loss. Instead, the author advocates for intermittent fasting, particularly the "clean" fast, as a free and effective strategy. They recommend looking into the benefits of fasting and reading Gin Stephens' books Fast, Feast, Repeat and Delay, Don't Deny for more guidance.

I've recently seen these Youtube shorts that promote The Smoothie Diet. I'm sure the Youtube channel that uploads these videos (@Animememes1) is simply grabbing some weight transformation videos from Tiktok, upload them as Shorts in their Youtube channel, and adding a link in the comments about the Smoothie Diet.

Please don't fall for this scam. These smoothies are so full of sugar, you don't want them on your bodies. The real weight-loss strategy is totally free &mdash; you don't have to pay a dime, you have nothing in advance to prepare: **Intermittent Fasting**. 

Look it up, especially about the power and benefits of the '*clean*' fast. And while you're at it, you would help yourself better if you try and read Gin Stephen's *Fast, Feast, Repeat* and *Delay, Don't Deny*.
