Bumped into this post on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/y5uaon/can_this_old_laptop_handle_plex/), asking if his 'old' laptop can handle Plex:

Imagine: a 7th-gen i5 with a dedicated NVIDIA graphics, and he's asking if his laptop can handle Plex. I'm sure this spec can handle 1 or 2 4K streams easily.

I have an old Beelink S1 Mini PC, with an Intel Celeron N3450, Quad Core, 4GB of RAM and 64GB eMMC, and this thing handles Plex well, albeit I only watch 720p movies and shows. But it's running not just Plex, but a host of other docker containers, including but not limited to:
- Radarr
- Sonarr
- Nginx Proxy Manager
- WordPress server and database
- Tautulli
- Portainer
- Syncthing
- Duplicati
- Jackett
- NZBGet
- Dockuwiki
- ruTorrent

So, yeah, to answer OP's question, it is very much capable.
