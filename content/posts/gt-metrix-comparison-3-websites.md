Ran my 3 websites on [GT Metrix](https://gtmetrix.com/compare/RWibuAUu/zCxqhGsH/Bt42ee12), and this is what I got:

***

[![GT Metrix Comparison: Deuts.org, Deuts.net, Chesshive.com](/uploads/gt-metrix-comparison.png)](/uploads/gt-metrix-comparison.png)

***

Current, they are running on the following platforms:

|       Website |  Platform |
|---------------|-----------|
|     deuts.org |      Hugo |
|     deuts.net | WordPress |
| chesshive.com | WordPress |

That goes to show how efficient static site generators like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) can be to make your websites more user and search friendly.
