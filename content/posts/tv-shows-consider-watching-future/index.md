These are the TV shows that I deleted from my Sonarr installation, but may consider following or monitoring them in the future.

- Bad Sisters
- Gaslit
- Hacks
- Mindhunter
- The Morning Show
- Only Murders in the Building Season 2
- Severance Season 2
- Slow Horses Season 2
- The Time Traveler's Wife
- Warrior
- What We Do in the Shadows

Several of these I have watched the Season 1 already, and will definitely add them back when Season 2 are ready.
