In the realm of technology's grand domain,  
**Deuts Log** stands proud, its knowledge to proclaim,  
An eclectic assortment, a journey to embark,  
Through subjects diverse, a technological spark.  

From deep within its digital core,  
It shares insights and more, galore,  
A tapestry woven with threads so fine,  
Unraveling mysteries in every line.  

Once upon [Tumblr](https://deuts.tumblr.com)'s vibrant stage,  
Deuts Log found its early page,  
But time's tide shifted, winds did blow,  
And changes came, as we all know.  

[Automattic](https://automattic.com/)'s grasp, a hopeful chance,  
To infuse new life, make Tumblr dance,  
Yet, alas, the vigor seemed to fade,  
Leaving Deuts Log in a contemplative shade.  

Unmet expectations, hopes held high,  
Transformation's wings failed to fly,  
In the unprogressive state it stayed,  
As Tumblr's spirit seemed to slowly fade.  

But a reboot beckoned, a fresh new morn,  
A decision made, from the old to be reborn,  
No transfer of tales, no digital freight,  
Instead, a choice to recreate.  

A Hugo-based haven, a virtual space,  
Where Deuts Log finds a new embrace,  
From modest past traffic to a future untold,  
A canvas reset, a story to unfold.  

So here's to beginnings, to paths anew,  
To Deuts Log's revival, bold and true,  
A tale of technology, of change and choice,  
In poetic verses, we give it voice.
