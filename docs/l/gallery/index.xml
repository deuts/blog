    WeddingShare is a very basic site with only one goal. It provides you and your guests a way to share memories of and leading up to the big day. Simply provide your guests with a link to a gallery either via a Url or even better by printing out the provided QR code and dropping it on your guests dinner tables. Doing so will allow them to view your journey up to this point such as dress/suit shopping, viewing the venue, doing the food tasting or cake shopping, etc. You are not limited to a single gallery. You can generate multiple gallerys all with their own sharable links.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
&lt;div class=&#34;linkding-notes&#34;&gt;
    We could have implemented this in Zoe&amp;rsquo;s baptism, for some kind of gimmick, at least.
