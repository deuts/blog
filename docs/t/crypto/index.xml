      <title>Why Bitcoin Is a Scam</title>

      <description>Bitcoin is often seen more as an investment than a currency. People rarely use it for transactions; instead, they buy it with the expectation that others will do the same, driving up its price. This behavior is also common with other cryptocurrencies, which some compare to a Ponzi scheme.</description>

<p>Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t really used much as a currency at all.</p>
<p>When people buy bitcoin, they rarely use it to buy goods and services. They&rsquo;re really buying access to a <strong>Ponzi scheme</strong>.</p>

<p>I subscribe to this school of thought. Bitcoin is probably a good idea as a currency. Problem is, people don&rsquo;t exchange their dollars for Bitcoin and use it to buy goods and services. Instead, they buy it in the hopes that other people will hop on the bandwagon, and cash-in on its price appreciation.</p>
<p>The same thing applies to other Cryptocurrencies.</p>
