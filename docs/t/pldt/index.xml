      <title>The PLDT Horror: 72 Hours (and Counting) Without Internet</title>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s been 72 hours without internet at home, and PLDT&amp;#39;s response has been nothing short of frustrating. From an initial promise of a 36-hour restoration to delays upon delays, this post dives into the reality of dealing with their lackluster service in Salcedo Village, Makati.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just when I thought I was done blogging about bad services, here I am again. I couldn&rsquo;t resist letting this one out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been almost 3 days without internet at home in Salcedo Village, Makati. The provider? None other than the <em>reliable</em> PLDT.</p>
<p>Their initial response when I reported the issue? I was assigned a ticket stating restoration may take—wait for it—up to 36 <em>hours</em>. Not great, but manageable, right? Fast forward 72 hours (double the time promised), and what do I get? A message saying they&rsquo;ll provide an <em>update</em> (not even a fix!) within another 48 hours.</p>
<p>PLDT, it seems, has no sense of urgency to address the concerns of its paying customers. If you&rsquo;re in the internet provider business, 1 day of downtime might be acceptable, but <em>three</em> days? That&rsquo;s absurd.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to PLDT’s stellar service, I’m forced to use my mobile hotspot for the weekend. What a bummer. I’ll be eating into my phone’s data provision just to get work done. Honestly, PLDT should be the one footing the bill for my backup internet.</p>
<p>And let’s not forget their audacity to lock customers into 3-year contracts! I wish Converge had been available in my building when I was shopping for wired internet 10 months ago. At least I&rsquo;d have a shot at better service.</p>
<p>So, PLDT service is <em>actually</em> this bad, huh? I always thought those horror stories were just urban myths—tales spun to scare unsuspecting subscribers. But nope, they’re real. And here I am, starring in my own PLDT nightmare.</p>

<p>After 85 hours of downtime, my PLDT internet was finally back online.</p>
