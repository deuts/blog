      <title>Yet another iPhone vs. Android post</title>

      <description>This discusses why I prefer Android over Apple, highlighting key features that are indispensable to me, such as dual SIM, torrenting apps, Syncthing, USB Type-C, customizable home screens, expandable storage, and dual accounts/profile. I also critique iMessage and Airdrop, explaining their preferences for alternatives.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Abrar Al-Heeti over at CNET discusses why she&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/im-now-team-apple-and-i-dont-think-ill-ever-go-back/">now Team Apple</a> and never going back.</p>
<p>If I were to summarize her reasoning for doing so, the major reason is <strong>iMessage</strong> and <strong>Airdrop</strong>. The rest are just aesthetics.</p>
<h2 id="imessage">iMessage</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have an iPhone right now, but who texts nowadays anyway? If you look closely at my messages app, they&rsquo;re mostly made up of OTPs and marketing messages. Not much from real contacts.</p>
<p>Where I&rsquo;m from and where I work, messaging is usually done via Viber and Facebook Messenger. So I&rsquo;ll just say damn to those who insist on iMessage.</p>
<p>Moreover, I think the Android messages app has a more robust anti-spam capability than the iPhone. By the way, did you know that you can&rsquo;t change the default SMS app in the iPhone?</p>
<h2 id="airdrop">Airdrop</h2>
<p>Who needs original quality photos? They&rsquo;re big in file size and you&rsquo;re not printing them into billboards anyway. And if you really need it, there are alternatives other than Google Drive.</p>
<h2 id="indispensable-on-my-android">Indispensable on my Android</h2>
<h3 id="dual-sim">Dual Sim</h3>
<p>Yes, there are dual-sim and e-Sim capable iPhones but you have to be very special to use one especially in the Philippines. Globe and Smart can only activate your e-Sim if you&rsquo;re on a postpaid plan. You&rsquo;ll need to procure yours from HongKong if you want a dual-sim iPhone. Almost every Android phone has dual-sim capability.</p>
<h3 id="torrenting-apps">Torrenting apps</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use my uTorrent app too often on my Android phone as I have a Qbittorrent hosted on a VPS, but I&rsquo;m glad that it&rsquo;s there when I need it.</p>
<h3 id="syncthing">Syncthing</h3>
<p>Not on an iPhone. Period.</p>
<h3 id="usb-type-c">USB Type-C</h3>
<p>This may change soon, but I&rsquo;m leaving it here anyway. I can carry around with me just one charger for my laptop, tablet and smartphone.</p>
<h3 id="customizable-home-screen">Customizable Home Screen</h3>
<p>This feature may become a time-waster sometimes, even a resource-hog, but the fact that I can move around app icons even to the bottom of the screen offers a lot of flexibility on how I want my phone to look each time I unlock it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not too convinced, check out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovaLauncher/">r/NovaLauncher</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NiagaraLauncher/">r/NiagaraLauncher</a> for inspiration.</p>
<h3 id="expandable-storage">Expandable Storage</h3>
<p>This feature probably becomes less attractive as built-in storage options become larger, but I&rsquo;m still attracted to this option, and plays a role in my decision to stick to Android, at least for the foreseeable future.</p>
<h3 id="dual-accountsprofile">Dual Accounts/Profile</h3>
<p>I know apps like Facebook and Messenger have the capability to run multiple profiles in the same app, but I don&rsquo;t think you can get notifications for them all.</p>
<p>With features like in the Samsung&rsquo;s secret folder, you can essentially have two separate Viber accounts for example running, and you&rsquo;ll get notifications from both accounts.</p>
