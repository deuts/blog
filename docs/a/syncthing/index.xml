      <description>After encountering a &amp;#34;No tracker connection available&amp;#34; issue, I’m reevaluating Resilio Sync’s reliability and whether my decision to use it over Syncthing was the right one.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>File synchronization tools are a cornerstone of my workflow, especially for keeping my Obsidian vaults updated across devices. For a while, Resilio Sync seemed like the perfect solution. But a recent issue has me questioning whether it’s as reliable as I believed.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-issue-no-tracker-connection-available">The Issue: &ldquo;No Tracker Connection Available&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Just today, I encountered an unsettling error in Resilio Sync: <strong>&ldquo;No tracker connection available.&rdquo;</strong> After a quick search, I found a <a href="https://forum.resilio.com/topic/75482-no-tracker-connection-available-and-download-configuration-file-test/">discussion in the Resilio Sync community</a> confirming that others are facing the same issue.</p>
<p>This raised several concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does Resilio Sync rely on a single centralized tracker server?</li>
<li>If so, is this a critical single point of failure?</li>
<li>Can I continue trusting this service for my essential files?</li>
</ul>
<p>The more I thought about it, the more uneasy I became about relying solely on Resilio Sync.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="why-this-is-a-problem">Why This Is a Problem</h3>
<p>Reliability is critical for any file synchronization tool. My files—and particularly my Obsidian vaults—must remain accessible, no matter what. A centralized server outage undermines this reliability, potentially leaving me unable to sync files when I need them most.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="why-i-chose-resilio-sync-over-syncthing">Why I Chose Resilio Sync Over Syncthing</h3>
<p>I switched to Resilio Sync after experiencing some frustrations with Syncthing. Here’s why:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Mobile App Support:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Resilio Sync has a reliable Android app and an official iOS app (even though I’m not using iOS right now).</li>
<li>Syncthing’s Android app has been <a href="https://forum.syncthing.net/t/discontinuing-syncthing-android/23002">discontinued</a>, and there’s no official iOS app, which made Resilio Sync the better choice for cross-platform use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Resilio Sync offers a polished GUI, whereas I found Syncthing’s login system problematic in the past.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Selective Sync:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This feature is a game-changer for saving storage space on mobile devices and is unavailable in Syncthing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These factors made Resilio Sync seem like the ideal solution. But today’s issue makes me wonder if I prioritized convenience over long-term reliability.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-bigger-picture-can-i-trust-resilio-sync">The Bigger Picture: Can I Trust Resilio Sync?</h3>
<p>This experience highlights an important question: should I rethink my choice of file synchronization tool? While Resilio Sync offers valuable features, its potential reliance on a central tracker server feels like a vulnerability.</p>
<p>I’m now left pondering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should I revisit Syncthing, even with its app limitations and lack of selective sync?</li>
<li>Are there other alternatives that balance reliability and functionality better?</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, I’ll be closely watching how quickly Resilio Sync resolves this issue. But one thing is certain: my trust in the platform has taken a hit.</p>
<h3 id="update-trackers-up-now">Update: Trackers Up Now</h3>
<p>After nearly 1.5 days, the trackers are finally back online. I wish Resilio Sync would provide an official announcement explaining the issue—it would go a long way in reassuring loyal users like me.</p>
